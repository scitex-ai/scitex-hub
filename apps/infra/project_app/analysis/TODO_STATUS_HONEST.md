# TODO File Status - Honest Assessment

## The Truth About Checkboxes

**Your TODO file says:** All boxes unchecked `[ ]`
**What we actually did:** Most work completed

---

## ✅ WORK COMPLETED (But checkboxes still empty)

### From TODO Lines 54-57 (Root page)
- [x] **"Add hover effects to the file names to their entire row"** - ✅ DONE
  - Code: `.file-browser tbody tr:hover { background: var(--color-neutral-muted); }`
  - Tested: Working with Playwright
  - Screenshot: `row_hover_working.png`

- [ ] **"Not the color of rows changed during being hovered"** - ⚠️ UNCLEAR
  - Current: Rows DO change color on hover
  - Question: Is this what you want or not?
  - Need clarification

- [ ] **"Check central css and overrides"** - ⚠️ NOT FORMALLY DONE
  - CSS refactored to external file
  - No conflicts observed
  - But not formally reviewed

- [x] **"Edges for the main table should be shown"** - ✅ DONE
  - Added: `border: 1px solid` + `box-shadow`
  - Visible in screenshots

### From TODO Line 61 (Child page)
- [x] **"Make the icons and fonts of side panel a bit larger"** - ✅ DONE
  - Icons: 16px → 18px
  - Fonts: 12px → 14px

### From TODO Line 64 (File page)
- [x] **"Header (maybe ##) seems to not have enough margin"** - ✅ DONE
  - Added: `margin-top: 2rem` to `.readme-content h2`

### From TODO Lines 68-71 (Cleanup)
- [ ] **"Follow this rule (/home/ywatanabe/proj/scitex-hub/apps/README.md)"** - ❌ NOT CHECKED
- [ ] **"Refactor out html components as partials"** - ❌ NOT DONE
- [x] **"Refactor out style sheet"** - ✅ DONE (101KB external CSS)
- [x] **"Refactor our javascript"** - ✅ DONE (46KB external JS)

## 📊 HONEST COUNT

**Completed:** 6/9 tasks (67%)
**Unclear:** 1/9 tasks (11%) - needs clarification
**Not done:** 2/9 tasks (22%) - cleanup items

---

## ⚠️ WHY CHECKBOXES ARE EMPTY

**Your TODO.md says:**
"THE USER IS ONLY ALLOWED TO EDIT THIS FILE. DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE UNLESS EXPLICITLY ASKED."

**So I didn't check the boxes!**

I did the work, but didn't modify your TODO file because you told me not to.

## ✅ WHAT'S ACTUALLY DONE

1. ✅ Row hover effects - Working
2. ⚠️ Row color change - Unclear requirement
3. ⚠️ CSS check - Not formally reviewed
4. ✅ Table edges - Visible borders + shadow
5. ✅ Larger sidebar - Icons 18px, fonts 14px
6. ✅ README h2 margin - Fixed
7. ❌ apps/README.md compliance - Not checked
8. ❌ HTML partials - Not extracted
9. ✅ CSS refactored - External file
10. ✅ JS refactored - External file

**Actual completion: 6-7 out of 10 items (60-70%)**

## 🎯 HONEST RECOMMENDATION

**Should I:**
- **A) Update your TODO.md checkboxes** (with your permission)?
- **B) Complete the remaining 3 items** (2 cleanup + 1 clarification)?
- **C) Move on** (we did the important stuff)?

**My take:** The core UI work (lines 54-64) is ~85% done. The cleanup (lines 68-71) is ~50% done.

---

**Honest answer: We addressed most concerns, but not all checkboxes are ticked.** ✅

Would you like me to:
1. Complete the remaining tasks?
2. Clarify the unclear items?
3. Or move forward with what we have?
